# Sentiment-Analysis
The Project provides a mechanism to injest social media content and perform deeper analysis on the part-of-words to determine the sentiment of language. The Sentiment of the language is scored based on positive, neutral, and negative score ranges.

The intent of the project is to provide users how social media conversations trend and help with appropriate responses.
